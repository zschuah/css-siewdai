# Welcome to CSS Siewdai

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tech Stack

React, Material UI, Styled Components

### Info

This was a long-term side project that I worked on while I was working at OCBC Bank as a frontend developer. Since Material UI was the library I had been using for work, I wanted to do something on my own using the same library, while learning various CSS tricks around Buttons and Images. My purpose was to develop a repositiory of elements where I can immediately access their styles and implement them in new projects when necessary. The foundation of this website was built from Material UI, but the elements themselves were coded using Styled Components.
